Series of tasks implemented from eudyptula

TASK 01:

Write a Linux kernel module, and stand-alone Makefile, that when loaded prints to the kernel debug log level, "Hello World!" Be sure to make the module be able to be unloaded as well.

The Makefile should build the kernel module against the source for the currently running kernel, or, use an environment variable to specify what kernel tree to build it against.

Please show proof of this module being built, and running, in your kernel. What this proof is is up to you, I'm sure you can come up with something. Also be sure to send the kernel module you wrote, along with the Makefile you created to build the module.

Remember to use your ID assigned to you in the Subject: line when responding to this task, so that I can figure out who to attribute it to. You can just respond to the task with the answers and all should be fine.

TASK 02:

Now that you have written your first kernel module, it's time to take off the training wheels and move on to building a custom kernel. No more distro kernels for you, for this task you must run your own kernel. And use git! Exciting isn't it! No, oh, ok...

The tasks for this round is:

    download Linus's latest git tree from git.kernel.org (you have to figure out which one is his, it's not that hard, just remember what his last name is and you should be fine.)
    build it, install it, and boot it. You can use whatever kernel configuration options you wish to use, but you must enable CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO=y.
    show proof of booting this kernel. Bonus points for you if you do it on a "real" machine, and not a virtual machine (virtual machines are acceptable, but come on, real kernel developers don't mess around with virtual machines, they are too slow. Oh yeah, we aren't real kernel developers just yet. Well, I'm not anyway, I'm just a script...) Again, proof of running this kernel is up to you, I'm sure you can do well.

Hint, you should look into the 'make localmodconfig' option, and base your kernel configuration on a working distro kernel configuration. Don't sit there and answer all 1625 different kernel configuration options by hand, even I, a foolish script, know better than to do that!

After doing this, don't throw away that kernel and git tree and configuration file. You'll be using it for later tasks, a working kernel configuration file is a precious thing, all kernel developers have one they have grown and tended to over the years. This is the start of a long journey with yours, don't discard it like was a broken umbrella, it deserves better than that.

Remember to use your ID assigned to you in the Subject: line when responding to this task, so that I can figure out who to attribute it to.

TASK 03:

Now that you have your custom kernel up and running, it's time to modify it!

The tasks for this round is:

    take the kernel git tree from Task 02 and modify the Makefile to and modify the EXTRAVERSION field. Do this in a way that the running kernel (after modifying the Makefile, rebuilding, and rebooting) has the characters "-eudyptula" in the version string.
    show proof of booting this kernel. Extra cookies for you by providing creative examples, especially if done in intrepretive dance at your local pub.
    Send a patch that shows the Makefile modified. Do this in a manner that would be acceptable for merging in the kernel source tree. (Hint, read the file Documentation/SubmittingPatches and follow the steps there.)

Remember to use your ID assigned to you in the Subject: line when responding to this task, so that I can figure out who to attribute it to.

TASK 04:

Wonderful job in making it this far, I hope you have been having fun. Oh, you're getting bored, just booting and installing kernels? Well, time for some pedantic things to make you feel that those kernel builds are actually fun!

Part of the job of being a kernel developer is recognizing the proper Linux kernel coding style. The full description of this coding style can be found in the kernel itself, in the Documentation/CodingStyle file. I'd recommend going and reading that right now, it's pretty simple stuff, and something that you are going to need to know and understand. There is also a tool in the kernel source tree in the scripts/ directory called checkpatch.pl that can be used to test for adhering to the coding style rules, as kernel programmers are lazy and prefer to let scripts do their work for them...

And why a coding standard at all? That's because of your brain (yes, yours, not mine, remember, I'm just some dumb shell scripts). Once your brain learns the patterns, the information contained really starts to sink in better. So it's important that everyone follow the same standard so that the patterns become consistent. In other words, you want to make it really easy for other people to find the bugs in your code, and not be confused and distracted by the fact that you happen to prefer 5 spaces instead of tabs for indentation. Of course you would never prefer such a thing, I'd never accuse you of that, it was just an example, please forgive my impertinence!

Anyway, the tasks for this round all deal with the Linux kernel coding style. Attached to this message are two kernel modules that do not follow the proper Linux kernel coding style rules. Please fix both of them up, and send it back to me in such a way that does follow the rules.

What, you recognize one of these modules? Imagine that, perhaps I was right to accuse you of the using a "wrong" coding style :)

Yes, the logic in the second module is crazy, and probably wrong, but don't focus on that, just look at the patterns here, and fix up the coding style, do not remove lines of code.

TASK 5:

Yeah, you survived the coding style mess! Now, on to some "real" things, as I know you are getting bored by these so far.

So, simple task this time around:

    take the kernel module you wrote for task 01, and modify it so that when a USB keyboard is plugged in, the module will be automatically loaded by the correct userspace hotplug tools (which are implemented by depmod / kmod / udev / mdev / systemd, depending on what distro you are using.)

Yes, so simple, and yet, it's a bit tricky. As a hint, go read chapter 14 of the book, "Linux Device Drivers, 3rd edition." Don't worry, it's free, and online, no need to go buy anything.
